              International university students in Australia have always faced
              challenges with their student experience, with some reporting to 
              "have difficulty connected with student communities and feeling detached."
              Due to Covid-19, these challenges have been magnified, maing it harder for 
              students studying offshore to connect. 
              <br></br>
              As the University of UNW, how can we better support our international students
              and improve their student university experience?

            students.

              Onshore International students at UNSW need to connect with other 
              international and domestic students because they need to build 
              meaningful relationships to fulfill their university 
              experience in way that is not intimidating, forced, or uncomfortable.

              Given that COVID-19 has magnified the challenges of social detachment
              faced by international students at UNW, how might we, as a non-profit 
              organisation, establish an opportunity for international students to immerse 
              themselves in the local social culture without social or cultural barriers so 
              that they can fulfill their expectations of the Australian university experience.

              Solution Space - Creating the Figma Prototype
            </Typography>
            <br></br>
            <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
              After extensive research on the problem, we have decided to prototype a study app that helps 
              international students to establish connections with other students (both international and
              domestic) to help them develop social skills and gain confidence. A pain that we identified was 
              how to get domestic students on the platform as they may already have friends. Here is where we 
              asked insight from our team industry mentor - Penny Talalak (Head of UX @ Z) and Luka Kasalovic (Campus Recruitment @ Quantium).
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
              From our discussion with our mentors we decided to include features that attract all students (including domestic) this includes features such as
                <ul>
                  <li>Linked to moodle for course information</li>
                  <li>Easily accessibly chat functions</li>
                  <li>Search filters for degrees, international/domestic, year, course etc</li>
                  <li>Study calls with no chat function and do not disturb</li>
                  <li>Spotify playlists for people to join</li>
                  <li>Pages dedicated to finding societies to centralise finding society events</li>
                </ul>
              Therefore, by centralising study resources, student societies, course information and chats onto an app we are able to 
              propose a solution to help connect all students onto one platform. See below for clips of some of our Figma flows demonstrating
              the app.
